Practice to build mean application
# Make sure you are attempting this test through Proctortrack and have your face always visible on the camera.

Using the provided database write a database-driven MEAN Stack application that performs the following tasks:
- Displays a list of customers. List the customers by name (in any order). (5 points: 2 backend + 2 frontend + 1 hardening)
- By clicking on one of the customers from step 1 you get the details of that customer. The details of a customer are (name, username, password, address, birth date, email, active status). (5 points: 2 backend + 2 frontend + 1 hardening)
- On the page that displays the single customer add the ability to deactivate the customer. When this button is clicked the customer's active status changes to "false". (2 points:: 1 backend + 1 frontend)
- Add the ability to go back from the page that displays the single story back to the page that displays the list of stories. (2 points)
- Make sure the name of your database is "meanCustomers" and the name of your collection is "customers", I should be able to start your whole application with "npm start ", (1 point)

Notes:
- Make sure you cover all the points addressed in the course when writing your program. You may also solve this problem in any order you wish.
- Your database does have more data than your application needs, this is because another team is working with that data for the feature they are developing.
- Do not worry about the following UI issues: active can display true/false, and the birthday can be displayed in any way (do not waste your time trying to make it look nice).
